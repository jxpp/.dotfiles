# Commented dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. I also include the shell script I utilize to sync them.
This repo is intended for personal use, but I've made it public in case I can
help someone with configuring some part of their workflow ðŸ™†.

I utilize GNU Stow to keep them synced and to quickly install them in any new
system.

## git
I include my system-wide `.gitignore` and my most common config.

## i3wm
I use [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3). My config closely resembles a
standard configuration, with very minor changes.

## tmux
A very simple configuration. Uses `vim`-like keybindings.

## .vimrc
This is packed with stuff, but it's all commented.
TODO: Change comments to English.

## kitty
I used kitty for a while. I no longer use it but the dotfiles are still there

## Xresources
I switched to urxvt, then to [xst](https://github.com/gnotclub/xst). All the
config for those is in here.
